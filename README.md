# valid-spec

Valid-spec is intended to be a utility repo to hold validation specs for use in various projects.

While recreating validation for inputs and values can be cathartic, the amount of time lost in
validating input can be annoying.

This clojure repo is intended to give a drop in, common list of specs that can be used for validating.


## Roadmap

As this will be a fairly simple project, there will be an attempt to document specs to quickly find what is needed.

Automation tools will be used where appropriate.
